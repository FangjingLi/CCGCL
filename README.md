# CCGCL
We conducted a novel exploration of combining features and topological structures, CCGCL: Graph Contrastive Learning Driven by Community Detection and Clustering, which explores the combination of features and structures. Specifically, we introduce the Adaptive Cluster Means (AC-means) clustering algorithm and the Adaptive Structural Community Detection (ASCD) algorithm. CCGCL employs adaptive mechanisms to dynamically optimize the selection of cluster numbers and balances group edge density and node proportions through adaptive weight adjustments. Furthermore, a multi-level weighted contrastive strategy is proposed, assigning higher weights to more distinctive negative samples, effectively mitigating the interference of false negatives and enhancing the discriminative power of negative samples. Experimental results demonstrate that CCGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification and node clustering tasks on multiple real-world graph datasets, validating effectiveness in capturing the complexity of graph structures and improving representation learning.
